Classes 1 and 2 perform poorly, likely due to class imbalance or insufficient feature separation.

Feature Importance Plot

The bar chart shows the top 10 most important features affecting accident severity (e.g., Speed, Vehicle Age, road and weather conditions).

If you'd like, I can show how to balance the classes or improve the model's performance. Want to try that?
